3. Relevant information:
	This dataset includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (353 mushrooms
	per species). Each mushroom is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of 
	unknown edibility and not recommended (the latter class was combined with the poisonous class).
	Of the 9 variables, 6 are nominal and 3 are metrical.

5. Class information:
	1. class		poisonous=p, edibile=e (binary)

6. Variable Information:
   (n: nominal, m: metrical; nominal values as sets of values)
   1. cap-diameter (m):			float number in cm
   2. does-bruise-bleed (n):	bruises-or-bleeding=t,no=f
   3. stem-height (m):			float number in cm
   4. stem-width (m):			float number in mm   
   5. stem-root (n):           bulbous=b, swollen=s, club=c, cup=u, equal=e,
                                rhizomorphs=z, rooted=r
   6. veil-type (n):           partial=p, universal=u
   7. has-ring (n):            ring=t, none=f
   8. season (n):		spring=s, summer=u, autumn=a, winter=w
